The unmanaged hosts should be defined as follows:

{
    "id": "HOST_ID",
    "use": "generic-passive-host",
    "hostgroups": [
        "mconf-live-servers",
        "mconf-network-members"
    ],
    "custom_variables": {
        "bbb_url": "BIGBLUEBUTTON_URL",
        "bbb_port": "BIGBLUEBUTTON_PORT",
        "bbb_salt": "BIGBLUEBUTTON_SALT"
    },
    "host_name": "HOST_NAME",
    "address": "HOST_ADDRESS"
}
